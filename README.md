# Version-Bump 🚀

Version: **v0.1.3**

Are you tired of manually updating version numbers in your project? Sick of forgetting to tag releases in Git? Say no more—**Version-Bump** is here to save your day (and your sanity). This tool is slick, funny, and as gritty as your late-night coding sessions.

## What is Version-Bump? 🤔

**Version-Bump** is a no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point tool for managing semantic versioning in your projects. Whether you’ve got a Python project, a Node.js app, or a README.md crying for a new version tag, this bad boy’s got you covered.

You:
- 🔢 Increment versions (major, minor, patch) with a single command.
- 🎉 Automatically update `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, and `README.md`.
- 💅 Tag your Git repo like a pro (no more "Oops, forgot the tag" situations).
- 🤯 Feel like a rockstar with every bump.

## Features 🌟

- **One-liner Bumps**: `version-bump --patch` to go from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1. Done.
- **Interactive Mode**: Want to choose the next version manually? We got you.
- **Git Integration**: Updates and commits only the files you actually changed.
- **Flexible**: Works even if you don’t have `pyproject.toml` or `package.json`. It just updates what’s there.
- **Force Mode**: Skip the confirmation and live on the edge with `--force`.
